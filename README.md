# UFOs
## Overview of Project
  *The purpose of this project was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter
   for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date,table filters for the city, state,country,and shape were added.
### Results
   * The Multiple criteria filters allowed for a more in depth analysis of UFOs sightings we can filter by date by 
    simply typing the date (1/13/2010) in the Enter Date filter search,we have three results.

  #### Summary
      one drawback of this design is the lack of standardization of the shape of the UFOs sightings, there were 
      eleven sightings that were discribed as "unknown" but a good look at the comments showed they could have been 
      discribed as lighting or as something else.

  #### Recommendation
      There is need for a standardization of the discription of the shape of the UFOs sightings 
      The information about the standardization of the shape of the UFOs sightings should be widely distributed
      among the UFOs sightings enthusiasts and general public.
